# GROW - Garden Remote Observer Worker

The primary goal is to provide a suite of tools to the grower (user) to help observe, document and control both the growing environment and plant health

Development is based on the Raspberry Pi primarily due to it's onboard capabilities, low power usage and low cost. The GPIO pins allow for non-usb and bluetooth sensors which gives the grower many options for what to measure and what to control. 

## Early development 

This project is in early development and has a ways to go before it will be highly usable. In the mean time I am interested in thought on directions for this to go.
